# Tandem — wire protocol (v1)

All endpoints under `/v1`, JSON bodies, `Authorization: Bearer <device-token>`.
Auth resolves to a Principal (tenant, member, device, capabilities); no
endpoint ever accepts a tenant or member identifier *for* the caller — who
you are always comes from auth.

## Envelope — `tandem.todo/1`

```json
{
  "schema":      "tandem.todo/1",
  "title":       "string, required",
  "notes":       "string, byte-identical, ≤ 10000",
  "checklist":   ["item title", "…"],
  "when":        "yyyy-mm-dd | someday | null",
  "deadline":    "yyyy-mm-dd | null",
  "context_url": null
}
```

`context_url` is a reserved seam (null in v1). No tags in the payload —
control tags never cross the wire, payload tags are dropped in v1, and the
provenance tag is computed by the hub (`from-<sender-handle>`, plus a
per-member emoji suffix where one's configured — `hub/ledger.py`'s
`provenance_tag()` / `_PROVENANCE_EMOJI`), not carried.

## Transfer state machine

```
created ──(create delivery acked with dst_uuid)──▶ applied
   │                                                  │
   │ (sender revokes before apply:                    │ (either side observes
   │  create skipped, resolved)                       ▼  terminal on their copy)
   └──────────────────────────────▶ terminal ∈ {completed, canceled}
                                        │ (echo delivery to the other
                                        ▼  party acked)
                                    resolved
```

Terminal is **set-once**, with one sanctioned upgrade: `canceled` →
`completed` (work done wins), permitted only while the cancel echo hasn't
been delivered. A `canceled` arriving after `completed` is ignored.

## Delivery state machine

```
queued ──(GET /v1/deliveries)──▶ leased ──(ack)──▶ done
  ▲                                 │
  └──(nack, or lease expiry)────────┘
```

Ordering guards enforced by the hub: a terminal delivery is never handed to
the recipient before the transfer has a `dst_uuid`; a terminal echo replaces
a still-queued create when the sender revoked first (the create is marked
done/skipped and the transfer resolves).

## Endpoints

### POST /v1/transfers — requires `can_send`
```json
{"to": "jill", "src_uuid": "THINGS-UUID", "rev": 1, "payload": {…envelope…}}
```
`201` with the transfer record, or `200` with `"deduped": true` on replay
(idempotent on `(from_member, src_uuid, rev)`). Errors: `403` (capability),
`404` (unknown recipient handle *in the caller's tenant*), `400`
(self-delegation, missing fields).

### GET /v1/deliveries?limit=N&wait=S — requires `can_receive`
Leases up to N deliveries for the calling member (long-polls up to S≤30s).
Lease TTL 300s; expiry re-queues. Each entry:
```json
{"id": "…", "transfer_id": "…", "kind": "create", "attempts": 1,
 "payload": {…envelope…}, "from": "bradley", "provenance_tag": "from-bradley 👨"}
```
or, for terminal kinds:
```json
{"id": "…", "transfer_id": "…", "kind": "complete|cancel", "attempts": 1,
 "uuid": "the caller's OWN copy's Things uuid"}
```

### POST /v1/deliveries/{id}/ack
Create kind: `{"dst_uuid": "…"}` (required — this is what closes the uuid
mapping). Terminal kinds: `{}`. Idempotent; re-acking a done delivery
returns `{"ok": true, "already_done": true}`.

### POST /v1/deliveries/{id}/nack
`{"error": "…"}` — re-queues immediately (client paces retries by tick).

### GET /v1/watch
Open (non-terminal, non-resolved) transfers the caller is party to:
```json
{"watch": [{"transfer_id": "…", "uuid": "their own copy's uuid",
            "role": "sender|recipient", "state": "created|applied"}]}
```
Senders use `state: "applied"` as the retag (delivery-receipt) signal.

### POST /v1/observations
`{"transfer_id": "…", "state": "completed|canceled"}` — report a terminal
state seen on a watched copy (trashed reports as `canceled`). Set-once
semantics above; always returns the winning terminal.

### GET /v1/health
`{"ok": true, "pending_deliveries": n, "open_transfers": n}`

### Admin (requires `can_admin`; scoped to the caller's tenant)
- `POST /v1/admin/tenants {"name"}` — bootstrap-only in practice
- `POST /v1/admin/members {"handle", "display_name", "can_send", "can_receive", "can_admin"}`
- `POST /v1/admin/devices {"member_id", "name"}` → `{"token"}` **shown once**
- `POST /v1/admin/devices/{id}/revoke`

Deployed provisioning is declarative (hub bootstrap spec + token files); the
admin API is the runtime escape hatch.

## Delivery semantics

At-least-once end to end. Every retry path is absorbed by an idempotency
anchor: transfer replays by the natural key, delivery queueing by
`(transfer, kind, member)`, applies by the spoke journal (re-correlate,
don't re-fire), acks by done-state no-ops, observations by set-once
terminal. The one residual (spoke journal lost AND ack lost in the same
window) degrades to a single visible duplicate on the recipient side.
