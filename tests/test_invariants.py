"""Invariant simulation: a real hub (in-process ledger) + two spokes over
fake Things accounts, driven through randomized chaos — writer crashes
after firing, lost hub responses (push/ack/observe), delayed ticks with
expired leases — asserting the three system invariants at quiescence:

  NO-LOSS   every delegated todo eventually materializes on the recipient
            (or is loudly refused), and every terminal state echoes back.
  NO-DUP    at most one live copy per side per transfer, ever.
  ROUND-TRIP every transfer ends resolved with both sides consistent.

Deterministic per seed; run several seeds. This is the test the ledger's
UNIQUE constraints, the delivery leases, and the spoke journal exist for.
